Data used for this analysis was found here: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m21/lms/starter/charity_data.csv

There are two jupyter notebook files in this repo:
    * "Starter_Code.ipynb"
    * "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb"

"Starter_Code" runs Test 1, a baseline test model and outputs the file: "AlphabetSoupCharity.h5" found in this repo.
"AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization" includes 3 additional test models and outputs "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5" also found in this repo.

An Explanation of the testing is found in this repo in: "Alphabet-Soup-Nonprofit-Funding-Analysis.pdf"
